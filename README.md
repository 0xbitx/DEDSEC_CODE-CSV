<h2 align="center">DEDSEC_CODE-CSV</h2>

### DESCRIPTION
DEDSEC_CODE-CSV is a Linux-based tool designed for securely injecting code or hidden messages into CSV files with ease and precision. This powerful utility enables users to embed sensitive content directly into CSV files by obfuscating the data, making it impossible to read without the corresponding deobfuscation process.

Featuring a user-friendly interface, DEDSEC_CODE-CSV simplifies the process of hiding your data while maintaining the original structure and usability of the CSV file. The tool applies obfuscation techniques to ensure that the inserted content remains undetectable to casual observers, protecting your data from unauthorized access or tampering.

Whether you're conducting secure operations, sharing protected information, or leveraging CSV files for covert purposes, CSV-TO-CODE is your go-to solution for combining data security with flexibility.
